# CAD-USD-Prediction
Prediction the value of Canadian Dollars to US Dollars using Back-Propagation Neural Network.

There are four dataset provided in TrainingTester.java:
+ data_set_1 (original)
+ data_set_2 (the expected outputs are rounded)
+ data_set_1_non_negative
+ data_set_2_non_negative

Drawback:
+ The network seem to be only capable of predicting the absolute value of the dollar change; therefore does not specify if the dollar will increase of decrease.
